## INSTALLATION

1. Clone repository to your local drive:<br>
   `git clone https://github.com/belarusconsul/Homework.git`

2. Most of the program has been written using Python's 3.9 standard library. In order to convert news to PDF format xhtml2pdf should be installed. If current program is installed through a Wheel file or a Source Distribution file, xhtml2pdf module is installed automatically. Otherwise you have to install it with its dependencies:<br>
   **Windows:**<br>
   `py -m pip install xhtml2pdf`<br>
   **Unix/MacOS:**<br>
   `python3 -m pip install xhtml2pdf`

3. You can run this program without installation. The executable script is in the master branch:<br>
   *<path to /Homework/NickolaiLychagin/rss_reader.py>*
   
4. Install prebuilt package to your computer:<br>
   **Windows:**<br>
   `py -m pip install <path to /Homework/NickolaiLychagin/dist/rss_reader-1.3-py3-none-any.whl>`<br>
   **Unix/MacOS:**<br>
   `python3 -m pip install <path to /Homework/NickolaiLychagin/dist/rss_reader-1.3-py3-none-any.whl>`<br>

   This installs program from a Wheel file (built distribution). If you prefer to use a Source Distribution file (source archive) run:<br>
   **Windows:**<br>
   `py -m pip install <path to /Homework/NickolaiLychagin/dist/rss_reader-1.3.tar.gz>`<br>
   **Unix/MacOS:**<br>
   `python3 -m pip install <path to /Homework/NickolaiLychagin/dist/rss_reader-1.3.tar.gz>`<br>

   After that you can run program through CLI utility rss_reader.

5. If you want to build the distribution package yourself, go to *<path to /Homework/NickolaiLychagin/>* in the master branch and run:<br>
   **Windows:**<br>
   `py -m build`<br>
   **Unix/MacOS:**<br>
   `python3 -m build`

## CACHE

News items retrieved from source URL are stored in a local SQL database in the 'news' table created as follows:
```
CREATE TABLE news
  (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
   channel TEXT, 
   url TEXT, 
   title TEXT, 
   date TEXT,
   date_as_date DATE, 
   desc TEXT, 
   image TEXT, 
   link TEXT UNIQUE)
```
If a news item does not have date or date is in the wrong format, it is saved to cache with the date "19000101" (January 1, 1900).
